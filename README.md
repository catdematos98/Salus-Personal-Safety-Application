# Salus-Personal-Safety-Application

Salus, a personal safety application, made by 5 female friends. 

Offers 6 different funtions:

1. Emergency Alert- the user can send out a preset default or customized text message to their emergency contacts with a single press.

2. Event Timer- Prior to leaving for an event, the user will input how long they will be out for and what they will be doing. Once the timer is finished running, it will ask the user if they are safe; pressing “No” or the lack of user input within 30 seconds will trigger an emergency alert, while pressing “Yes” or “Extend time” will ask the user to enter their PIN to stop or extend the function.

3. GPS Tracking- The GPS tracker is functional after the power button is pressed 3 times in a row. The user must have turned on location in order for this to work. When the function is triggered, the user’s GPS coordinates and an automatically generated password will be sent to the user’s emergency contacts. The emergency contacts receive a message stating that the user is in danger. To find their location, the contacts must access their app and enter the username and password given to find the coordinates of the person in danger.

4. Audio Recording- With this function, you can click a duration of time you wish to record audio for. After clicking a duration of either 5, 10, or 15 minutes, press the “Start” button to begin recording. After time is up, you will receive a link containing the audio recording.

5. Siren- The siren function allows to user to alert people around them that they are unsafe. Immediately after the user clicks the button, a loud siren sound is played to notify that the user is in danger, and needs help.

6. Fake Call- The function is triggered when the user clicks the green accept call button and the ringtone is then played, and the screen is designed to look like an actual call screen. When the function is triggered the user immediately receives a fake phone call alert ringtone. The user can either allow the ringtone finish playing, or press the red decline button to end the ringtone.
